# Skill-Gap-Analysis

An AI-powered Skill Gap Analysis Tool that compares job descriptions with a userâ€™s existing skills to identify missing competencies. The dataset used was a csv file which contains over 1 lakh records consisting of job title and keywords as features. The data was cleaned and preprocessed for further usage and implementation. It integrates NLP techniques for skill extraction and uses clustering algorithms (K-Means) for structured categorization. The system also provides personalized course recommendations to bridge skill gaps.

Technologies Used: Python, NLP (Sentence-BERT), K-Means Clustering, PCA Data Processing: Pandas, Scikit-Learn, NLTK

Recommendation System: Rule-Based Approach

Key Results: Improved silhouette score by 54% using PCA for better skill clustering.
